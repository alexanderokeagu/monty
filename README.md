C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

About: In this project, we created a simple interpreter for Monty ByteCodes. The interpreter reads a bytecode file and executes the bytecode commands.

The Monty language
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it.

Monty byte code files
Files containing Monty byte codes usually have the .m extension. Most of the industry uses this standard but it is not required by the specification of the language. 

Objectives:
At the end of this project,one should understand:-
1.What do LIFO and FIFO mean
2.What is a stack, and when to use it
3.What is a queue, and when to use it
4.What are the common implementations of stacks and queues
5.What are the most common use cases of stacks and queues
6.What is the proper way to use global variables.
